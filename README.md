Loopy Belief Propagation and Bethe Approximations

sum-product function(A,w,its)
this function will return Z

A is the number adjacency matrix with size N x N
w is the weight indicating colors
its is total number of iteration

example :
A = [ 0 1 ; 1 0 ];
w = [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 ; 5 ];
its = 100

max-product function(A,w,its)
it will return MAP assignment
input should be same as before
